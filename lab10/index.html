  		<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
  		<p>The purpose of this lab is to experiment with JS events.</p>

  		<h2>Challenges</h2>
  		<p>The lab was overall a little difficult to understand, but we were able to get
      the hang of it with the help of "Inspect." Through trial and error, we were able
      to compare the different values and review the parts of our code that wasn't working.

      <h2>Task X: Results</h2>
      <p>We were able to figure out how to do the glitch effect through the help of
      Stackoverflow! The effect that we added for the second button allows for a very
      quick movement of letters and symbols.</p>

  		<h2>Results</h2>
  		<p>Refer to the results below:</p>

      <input type="Input your name:" id="user-name">

      <br>

      <button id="my-button">Submit</button>

      <div id="output">
        <p id="name-results">
      </div>

      <h1 id="text"></h1>
  <button type="button" id="but">Click me...</button>

    </div>

</body>
