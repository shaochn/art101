		<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
		<p>The purpose and idea of this lab was to allow the students to
			understand what the local file structure consists of, as well
			as to add and edit index.html files.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>At first, my partner Laiy and I weren't sure how we can include
			an image through our local port. However, with some help from Google,
			we were able to figure it out; you had to drag the photo into the img
			folder.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Things went along pretty smoothly! We were able to get the project
			successfully done!</p>
