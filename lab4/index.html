		<h1 style="text-align:center">Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
		<p>The purpose and idea of this lab was to allow the students to
			understand what pseudocoding is and how essential it is to start on this
			step before coding.</p>

		<h2 style="text-align:center">Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was fairly easy and simple, so Nailea and I didn't have any issues
		with completing this lab!</p>

		<h2 style="text-align:center">>Results</h2>
		<p>Things went pretty smoothly! We were able to devise a pseudocode of the
		game Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p>

		<h2 style="text-align:center">>Pseudocode</h2>

		<pre><code>

			// Summary. Pseudocoding for a standard rock, paper, scissors game.
			// Description. A game where the players can select three options (rock,
			paper, scissors), in which there's one option can override the other.
			// @file   This files defines the MyClass class.
			// @author Shao Chen and Nailea Llamas
			// @since  04/12/22

			//Identify the three options they can choose from
		  	// Options Rock, Paper, or Scissors
			//Figure out all total combinations + which option overpowers the other one
		  	// Rock overrides Scissors, Paper overides Rock, Scissors overrides Paper
			//Take in both userâ€™s input
			//Tells which player wins (confetti!)
