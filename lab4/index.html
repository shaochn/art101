		<h1 style="align: center">Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
		<p>The purpose and idea of this lab was to allow the students to
			understand what pseudocoding is and how essential it is to start on this
			step before coding.</p>

		<h2 style="align: center">Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was fairly easy and simple, so Nailea and I didn't have any issues
		with completing this lab!</p>

		<h2 style="align: center">Results</h2>
		<p>Things went pretty smoothly! We were able to devise a pseudocode of the
		game Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p>
