		<h1 style="text-align:center">Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<p>The purpose and idea of this lab was for the students to understand basic JavaScript fundamentals, such as by establishing different variables and data types.</p>

		<h2 style="text-align:center">Challenges</h2>
			<p>We had an issue where the "console.log()" wasn't recgonizing the variables; however, after restarting the laptop, things started going a lot more smoothly.</p>

		<h2 style="text-align:center">Results</h2>
			<p>We were able to devise a successful JavaScript file! We were able to get the project successfully finished.</p>

		<h2 style="text-align:center">Script Output</h2>
		<script src="js/lab5.js"></script>
