		<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<p>The purpose and idea of this lab was for the students to understand the different
		kinds of basic Javascript data types and variables.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>There was a slight issue where we couldn't get console.log("My Main transportation
				: " + myMainRide) to work. We were able to resolve it later after working it out.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>We were able to devise a successful JavaScript output!</p>
