		<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
		<p>The purpose and idea of this lab was for the students to create functions that
    are able to take user input and manipulate a string.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>We had an issue with the output because the Javascript function wasn't appearing
      on the screen. After some tests, we found out that cutting off a snippet of
      code worked!</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>We were able to devise a successful JavaScript function!</p>
