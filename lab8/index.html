  		<h1>Lab 8 - Functions</h1>
  		<p>The purpose and idea of this lab was for the students to work with anonymous
      functions and callbacks.</p>

  		<h2>Challenges</h2>
  			<p>There weren't any issues that had occured during this lab. We only realized that
        it would be easier to work with the array if we only used one variable (x) instead
        of two (x,y); originally, we were going to do subtraction, but we did squared instead.</p>

      <h2>Task X: Results</h2>
      <p>2. We were able to figure out to use a callback within one of our javascript outputs
      by adding "setTimeout(function()" in front of the console.log. We set it to 3 seconds,
      so that the results of the array map squared would be delayed.</p>

  		<h2>Results</h2>
  		<p>Visit the console to view the output!</p>
