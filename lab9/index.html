  		<h1>Lab 8 - Functions</h1>
  		<p>The purpose of this lab is to experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>

  		<h2>Challenges</h2>
  		<p>The lab was a little difficult to get a hang of, especially as it took me
      a bit of time to understand what they were looking for. After communicating with
      my partner and searching for more information in the lecture and online, we were
      able to find a solution.</p>

      <h2>Task X: Results</h2>
      <p>1. We had used "appendChild" for this assignment, which would help add an
      additional element to the bottom of the element. Laiy had experimented a bit more
      and had figured out that "outputEl.insertBefore" can be used to print a new element
      above the existing element.</p>

  		<h2>Results</h2>
  		<p>Refer to the results below:</p>
